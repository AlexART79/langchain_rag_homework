Automated Regulatory Dossier

The Automated Regulatory Dossier R&D Project is designed to enhance and simplify the creation of regulatory dossiers by introducing a platform where users can upload Word document templates that include designated placeholders. Leveraging automated parsing capabilities, the system will accurately detect and list all unique placeholders within the uploaded templates, supporting streamlined document assembly and improved review processes.



Business & Technical Context

Business Challenges

That were presented to us

Manual document creation is time-consuming and error-prone

Regulatory documents require consistent formatting and accurate data

Multiple templates need to be processed with same placeholder values

No centralized tool for batch document generation

That we discovered along the way

Word documents have complex internal structure with text split across runs

Placeholder detection needs to handle various formatting scenarios

CSV/XLSX import requires auto-detection of delimiters and encoding

Session isolation needed for multi-user concurrent usage



Business Goals

Automate regulatory dossier creation process

Reduce manual effort in document preparation

Ensure consistency and accuracy in generated documents

Provide intuitive interface for non-technical users







Technical Limitations & Challenges

Word document XML structure splits text across multiple runs

Placeholder patterns need flexible regex matching

Preserving document formatting during text replacement

Architecture



Basic flows and interactions

User creates a new session via the UI

User uploads DOCX templates with placeholders ({{name}} or [[name]])

System parses templates and extracts unique placeholders

User fills placeholder values via UI or imports from XLSX/CSV

System generates final documents with replaced values

User downloads all generated documents as ZIP archive

Lessons learnt (technical, process or organizational)

Public

What was good

Team successfully delivered end-to-end document processing workflow

Modern tech stack enabled rapid development

Team successfully demonstrated demo to stakeholders with great feedback

What could be better

Earlier alignment on all placeholder format requirements

More comprehensive testing coverage from start



Private

What was good

Team collaboration was effective

Clear separation of frontend/backend responsibilities

Good code quality and documentation practices



Benefits (numbers are preferable).

Time Savings (up to 88%): Automated placeholder extraction eliminates manual document analysis

Error Reduction (up to 69%): Consistent placeholder replacement reduces human errors

Scalability: Batch processing of multiple templates in single session

User-Friendly: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface requires no technical expertise
